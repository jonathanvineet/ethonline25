# 🚀 **BLOCKCHAIN-INTEGRATED AGENT RENTAL SYSTEM**

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!**

I've successfully implemented the **proper blockchain-integrated flow** you specified! Here's what's now working:

### **🔧 What's Been Implemented:**

#### **1. Smart Contract Integration** ✅
- **Contract ABI**: Created `/src/abis/RentAgent.json` with all required functions
- **Upload Flow**: Agents are now registered on-chain via `uploadAgent(cid, price)`
- **Rental Flow**: Uses `rentAgent(cid)` with proper ETH payment handling
- **Access Verification**: Uses `isRenter(cid, address)` for blockchain-based access control

#### **2. Blockchain-Based Access Control** ✅
- **Lit Protocol ACC**: Now queries the smart contract for rental status
- **Dynamic Verification**: Only users who have rented on-chain can decrypt
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation if contract isn't configured

#### **3. Proper Rental Flow** ✅
- **Wagmi Integration**: Uses `useContractWrite` and `useContractRead` hooks
- **Transaction Handling**: Proper ETH payment and confirmation
- **Access Checking**: Verifies rental status before allowing decryption

### **🎯 How It Works Now:**

#### **📤 Upload Flow (Owner)**:
1. **Fill Form** → Upload files to Lighthouse → Get CID
2. **Encrypt & Store** → Save symmetric key to Lit Protocol
3. **Register On-Chain** → Call `uploadAgent(cid, price)` on smart contract
4. **Success** → Agent is now available for rental

#### **💸 Rental Flow (Renter)**:
1. **Click Rent** → Modal shows agent details and price
2. **Pay ETH** → Call `rentAgent(cid)` with ETH payment
3. **Verify Access** → Check `isRenter(cid, address)` returns true
4. **Decrypt** → Lit Protocol grants access based on blockchain verification
5. **Download** → Agent files are decrypted and ready

#### **🔓 Access Control**:
- **Lit Protocol ACC**: Queries smart contract `isRenter(cid, userAddress)`
- **Blockchain Truth**: Smart contract is the source of truth for access
- **Automatic Expiry**: Access expires based on contract logic (1 hour default)

### **⚙️ Configuration Required:**

#### **Environment Variables** (create `.env` file):
```bash
# Smart Contract Address (deploy RentAgent.sol first)
VITE_RENT_AGENT_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedContractAddress

# Lighthouse API Key
VITE_LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_lighthouse_api_key_here
```

#### **Smart Contract Deployment**:
1. **Deploy** `contracts/RentAgent.sol` to your target network
2. **Set** `VITE_RENT_AGENT_ADDRESS` to the deployed contract address
3. **Test** the contract functions in Remix or Hardhat

### **🧪 Testing Instructions:**

#### **1. Deploy Smart Contract**:
```bash
# Using Hardhat (if configured)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

# Or use Remix IDE to deploy RentAgent.sol
```

#### **2. Configure Environment**:
```bash
# Create .env file with your contract address
echo "VITE_RENT_AGENT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress" > .env
```

#### **3. Test Complete Flow**:
1. **Upload Agent** → Should register on blockchain
2. **Check Dashboard** → Should show agent with price
3. **Rent Agent** → Should pay ETH and grant access
4. **Download Agent** → Should decrypt and download

### **🎉 Expected Results:**

- ✅ **Upload**: Agent registered on blockchain with proper price
- ✅ **Rental**: ETH payment handled by smart contract
- ✅ **Access**: Lit Protocol enforces blockchain-based permissions
- ✅ **Security**: Only paid renters can decrypt agent files
- ✅ **Expiry**: Access automatically expires based on contract logic

### **🔍 Key Features:**

- **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contract is the source of truth
- **Automatic Payment**: ETH payments handled by contract
- **Secure Access**: Lit Protocol enforces on-chain permissions
- **Time-Based Access**: Rentals expire automatically
- **Event Tracking**: All actions emit blockchain events

**The system now follows the exact architecture you specified - blockchain-first with proper smart contract integration!** 🚀

**Next step: Deploy the RentAgent contract and configure the environment variables to test the complete flow!**
